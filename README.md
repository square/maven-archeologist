# Maven archeology

A library to make resolving maven artifacts (from various repositories) easy.  The library itself
wraps the Maven resolver APIs and provides simple HTTP-based resolution. From this any number of
tools can be constructed, which require obtaining (and locally caching) maven artifacts, resolving
the "effective project model", validating hashes, etc.

## Usage

The main entry point to the library, which wraps (and mostly hides) the Maven resolution
infrastructure, is `ArtifactResolver`.  It has two ways to use it - the simple one which just
downloads the relevant artifact and its POM file, and returns the file locations, or a slightly
more nuanced API, which lets you get resolved Maven metadata (but doesn't download the artifact).

### Simplest Usage

In this variant, the API just downloads the POM and artifact files and their hash files, validates
the files, and returns POM and artifact files to you in a pair. 

```kotlin
val resolver = ArtifactResolver() // creates a resolver with repo list defaulting to Maven Central.
val (pom, artifact) = resolver.download("com.google.guava:guava:27.1-jre")
```

### Resolving Metadata

This is the more robust way to use the API, and it gets you a `ResolvedArtifact`, which contains
the fully resolved model object (resolved dependencies (including from dependencyManagement and
properties substitutions)). The resolved artifact can then be used to fetch the main artifact.

```kotlin
val resolver = ArtifactResolver() // creates a resolver with repo list defaulting to Maven Central.
val artifact = resolver.artifactFor("com.google.guava:guava:27.1-jre") // returns Artifact
val resolvedArtifact = resolver.resolveArtifact(artifact) // returns ResolvedArtifact
val result = resolver.download(resolvedArtifact) // returns FetchStatus

// if you care about whether it was a cache-hit or not, do this. Otherwise test for "is SUCCESSFUL"
when (result) {
  is SUCCESSFUL.FOUND_IN_CACHE -> { /* win! */ }
  is SUCCESSFUL.SUCESSFULLY_FETCHED -> { /* win, but remotely! */ }
  else -> { /* Handle error */ }
}
```

### Adding Repositories

The resolver defaults to resolving against Maven Central. Specifying repositories is as simple as:

```kotlin
val repo1 = Repository().apply {
  id = "some-identifier"
  releases = RepositoryPolicy().apply { enabled = "true" }
  url = "https://some.server/path/to/repo" // At present, only http/https are supported.
}
val repo2 = ...
val resolver = ArtifactResolver(repositories = listOf(rep1, rep2))
```
> Note: This is one of the rare times you'll directly interact with Maven's internal APIs, except
> for interacting with the `Model` object if you resolve the effective-model.

Reasonably popular repositories have been pre-defined in the `Repositories` type, e.g.
`Repositories.MAVEN_CENTRAL`

### Local Artifact Cache (Maven Local Repository)

By default, artifacts are cached in `${HOME}/.m2/repository`, but this can be changed (per resolver
instance) like so:

```kotlin
val resolver = ArtifactResolver(cacheDir = fs.getPath("/some/cache/dir"))
```

### Comparing Versions

maven-archeologist has a convenience for representing maven versions in a way that they can be
compared according to semantic versioning, or at least the maven 3 variant, rather than merely
lexically.

```kotlin
val versions = listOf(
  MavenVersion.from("2.3.5-SNAPSHOT"),
  MavenVersion.from("2.3.5"),
  MavenVersion.from("2.0"),
  MavenVersion.from("2a.0"),
  MavenVersion.from("2.0-beta"),
  MavenVersion.from("2.0-beta-SNAPSHOT"),
  MavenVersion.from("2.3.5.2"),
).sorted()

println(versions)
// should print [2.0-beta-SNAPSHOT, 2.0-beta, 2.0, 2.3.5-SAPSHOT, 2.3.5, 2.3.5.2, 2a.0]
```

> Note: 2a.0 comes after 2.0 because 2a is non-numeric and so is lexically compared.

## Demo CLI

The project also contains a demo CLI app which will resolve and download the maven artifacts listed
on the repository, cache them in a defined directory. It is iterative and single-threaded, so not
suitable for high-volume resolution, but it can help for small tasks and show how to wield the APIs.
```shell
bazel run //:resolver -- --local_maven_cache /path/to/cache some:artifact:1 another:artifact:2
```

## Possible uses

  * Build a dependency graph scanning/analysis tool
  * Use in non-Maven build tools for easier use of Maven resolution
  * Pre-fetching artifacts to permit later off-line function.
  * ...

## Core Capabilities

  * Basic wrapping of Maven APIs into much simpler conveniences
  * Basic artifact resolution to a maven model object
  * Downloading of POM and artifact files
    - file caching in (and resolution from) a maven-style local repository (cache)
  * md5/sha1 validation for files published with the accompanying hash files (maven-style)
  * Resolving from multiple/different/custom repositories
    - by default, for security, pinning the list of repositories to the given set, ignoring
      attempts from maven metadata to add more repositories, though this can be overridden
  * Metadata about the resolution/fetch operations, including whether the file(s) were satisfied
    from the cache or a remote fetch occurred.
  * Basic example CLI to resolve artifacts and find dependencies.

## Known Limitations

  * Does not download sub-artifacts (-sources.jar) or classifiers (yet)
  * Does not do any traversal (this can be done in calling code) of dependencies or other
    transitive operations
  * No multithreaded operations (though calling code can build a parallel graph walk around it)
    - file writes DO use a "write to temp file, atomically move" strategy, so generally the
      library should be tolerant of race-condition in resolution/download.
  * Has a crappy heuristic (with a hack for bundle) for converting packaging->suffix
    - Doesn't resolve plugin metadata that might configure things like that.
  * The CLI is super limited as a demo-app.
  * Basic functionality is tested, but coverage is weak.
  * Might need some more ability to configure them (without bailing out of the wrapper
    infrastructure entirely)

## Planned features

> Note: These are all doable in calling code, but some of these should be useful in the core
> library.

  * transitive/bulk operations on artifacts
    - pre-download all files needed to do off-line resolution later
    - gather the full maven universe implied by the offered initial artifacts
    - identify diamond dependency skew and other dependency conflicts
  * Download -sources artifacts and possibly other sub-artifacts.
  * more useful CLI functionality
